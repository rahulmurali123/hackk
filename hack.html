            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The brake system provided on the wagons with BMBS is single / twin pipe graduated release system with automatic two
              stage braking. Its operating principle is as follows.
              Schematic layout of single / twin pipe graduated release air
              brake system as provided on the wagons is shown in sketches
              below. Brake pipe/ Feed pipe runs through the length of
              wagon. Brake pipes / Feed pipes on consecutive wagons in a
              train are coupled to one another by means of hose coupling to
              form a continuous air passage from the locomotive to the rear
              end of the train. Brake pipe is charged to 5 kg/cm2
              through the
              compressor of the locomotive. Brake pipe is charged to
              5 kg/cm2
              through the compressor of the locomotive. Feed pipe
              is charged to 6kg/cm2
              .
              The wagons are provided with automatic pressure modification (APM) device EL-60 valve to cater for higher brake
              power in loaded condition instead of the conventional manual
              empty load device.
              With the provision of this, brake cylinder pressure of 2.2 ±
              0.25 kg/cm2
              is obtained in empty condition and 3.8 ± 0.1
              kg/cm2
               is obtained in the loaded condition. To obtain this a
              change over mechanism, APM under-frame and side frame of
              the bogie. The mechanism gets actuated at a pre-determined
              change over weight of the wagon and changes the pressure
              going to the brake cylinder from 2.2± 0.25 kg/cm2
              to 3.8 ± 0.1
              kg/cm2
              incase of changeover from empty to loaded and viceversa.
