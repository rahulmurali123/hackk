No one was injured in the accident, which affected train services in the Adra division of SER for over four hours, he said.After two goods trains collided at Onda railway station in Bankura, a railway official said that the goods train (BCN) overshot the red signal, didn't stop, and derailed with the BRN maintenance train. The railways have restored the UP Mail Line and UP Loop Line, and train movement has resumed. Eleven trains have been cancelled so far.</p>

            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">Automatic Pressure Modification Sensor</h1>
            <p class="lead">Pressure measurement is the measurement of an applied force by a fluid (liquid or gas) on a surface. Pressure is typically measured in units of force per unit of surface area. Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and vacuum. Instruments used to measure and display pressure mechanically are called pressure gauges, vacuum gauges or compound gauges (vacuum & pressure). The widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.
                A vacuum gauge is used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (for instance, −1 bar or −760 mmHg equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as "gauge pressure". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point reference must be used, giving pressure reading as an absolute pressure. </p>
